The dataset is about iris plant 

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper [2] is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant, each instance contains the information of sepal length/width, petal width/length, iris class. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
This is an exceedingly simple domain.

Noted that, for this dataset, you need to download this file https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data and rename it to .csv
